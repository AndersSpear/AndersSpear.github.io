            <h2>GRASS</h2>
            <div style="padding-left:15px;">
                <h3>Alfalfa</h3>
                <img src="images/alfalfa.jpg" alt="alfalfa">
                <p>Alfalfa (/ælˈfælfə/), also called lucerne and called Medicago sativa in binomial nomenclature, is a perennial flowering plant in the legume family Fabaceae. It is cultivated as an important forage crop in many countries around the world. It is used for grazing, hay, and silage, as well as a green manure and cover crop.</p>

                <h3>Bentgrass</h3>
                <img src="images/Bentgrass.jpg" alt="bentgrass">
                <p>Bentgrass can be found on most golf courses in the Northern U.S. It can be mowed as low as 1/10" and makes an ideal surface for putting greens and fairways. Even when mowed very low, it forms a dense turf with a very fine-textured feel. </p>
                <br>

                <h3>Centipede</h3>
                <img src="images/Centipede.jpg" alt="centipede">
                <p>Centipede grass spreads above the ground through stolons and forms a dense turf. Because it grows horizontally, it requires less mowing and is easy to edge around garden beds and sidewalks. It is found throughout the warm-humid areas of the South. It does not grow well in hot, dry areas and will die if not supplied with adequate moisture. However, it requires less fertilizer than other warm-season types.</p>
